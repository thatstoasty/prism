trait Reader(Movable):
    """Reader is the trait that wraps the basic Read method.

    Read reads up to len(p) bytes into p. It returns the number of bytes
    read (0 <= n <= len(p)) and any error encountered. Even if Read
    returns n < len(p), it may use all of p as scratch space during the call.
    If some data is available but not len(p) bytes, Read conventionally
    returns what is available instead of waiting for more.

    When Read encounters an error or end-of-file condition after
    successfully reading n > 0 bytes, it returns the number of
    bytes read. It may return the (non-nil) error from the same call
    or return the error (and n == 0) from a subsequent call.
    An instance of this general case is that a Reader returning
    a non-zero number of bytes at the end of the input stream may
    return either err == EOF or err == nil. The next Read should
    return 0, EOF.

    Callers should always process the n > 0 bytes returned before
    considering the error err. Doing so correctly handles I/O errors
    that happen after reading some bytes and also both of the
    allowed EOF behaviors.

    If len(p) == 0, Read should always return n == 0. It may return a
    non-nil error if some error condition is known, such as EOF.

    Implementations of Read are discouraged from returning a
    zero byte count with a nil error, except when len(p) == 0.
    Callers should treat a return of 0 and nil as indicating that
    nothing happened; in particular it does not indicate EOF.

    Implementations must not retain p."""
